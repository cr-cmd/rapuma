This is a message from Bobby de Vos about a new version of XeTeX:

Greetings,

NRSI is working on a font called Awami [1] to handle Nastaliq style text. To fully support this font, a new parameter called \XeTeXinterwordspaceshaping has been added to XeTeX in version 0.99996 [2]. This parameter needs to be set for full support of Awami. The following text (which will ship with the Paratext Print Draft functionality) has more details.

% Control how cross-space contextualization is handled.

% No cross-space contextualization.
% This is how XeTeX behaves by default.
% Most projects will use this setting.
%\XeTeXinterwordspaceshaping = 0

% Some cross-space contextualization.
% Spaces between words are adjusted,
% but the rendering of individual words is not affected by the spaces.
%\XeTeXinterwordspaceshaping = 1

% Full cross-space contextualization.
% Spaces between words are adjusted,
% and the rendering of individual words is affected by the spaces.
%\XeTeXinterwordspaceshaping = 2

Place this text into your .tex file and uncomment the level you need.

Available with TeX Live 2016 pre-test releases. XeTeX from this source comes with Graphite version 1.3.8 which supports Awami.

Dennis,

The situation with Paratext varies depending on the platform

    Paratex on Windows has its own copy of xetex.
    Paratext on Linux uses xetex as packaged by Ubuntu

You can get the source code for XeTeX from https://sourceforge.net/p/xetex/code/ci/master/tree/ and then compile a new binary

Or it might work to get the needed binaries from TeX Live 2016 pre-test from https://www.tug.org/texlive/pretest.html

I am not saying you have to upgrade Rapuma, I am not your boss after all. Just pointing out changes in the world that might affect you.

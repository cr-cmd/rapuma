RAPUMA (RApid PUblication MAnager) is intended to be a system for managing publication data that could be used for output in a variety of media. Rapuma takes data from the editing environment and allows the user to create, manage and apply repeatable processes to the publication data for output. An example would be a USFM manuscript created and edited in ParaTExt being output to a print-ready PDF document. This would be for printing a book which contains all its components such as front and back matter, contents, maps and cover. Rapuma should be able to manage all the various processes that go into a publication such as this and when it is complete, all the data components ready for archiving.

STATUS: Currently Rapuma is under heavy development (by a single, part-time, amateur Python programmer) and only has a command line API. There are hopes to develop a GUI once a useful number of features have been implemented. Deployment of Rapuma in a limited scope, primarily text processing, began in October 2012. It is hoped it will be "feature-adequate" by early 2013, in time to do a Bible publication. (We'll see how that goes.)

These instructions are for manually installing the developer version of the Rapuma publishing system package on a typical Ubuntu operating system (currently Precise, 12.04). Ultimately we want Rapuma to completely install from the package but at this point, given the state of flux it is in, it is best to get the latest code from the repository and manually install it. The installation commands listed here will be done in the terminal. If you have not opened a terminal yet, do it now.


REQUIRED PACKAGES
-----------------------------------------
There are a number of packages that need to be installed for Rapuma to work. Some are more critical than others but all of them are needed. Some of the packages are located in other repositories that you will need to add to your system repository source list. Fastest way is to open the sources.list file for editing with this command in your terminal:

    sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list

Next, in gedit in the file you just opened, go to the bottom of the file and add this line if it does not already exist in the file:

    deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu precise main

Save the file and close it.

Again, in the terminal, update your package list and update your system with the following command:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade

Note the upgrade could take some time. Also, if it asks, answer yes to the "install without verification" question.

Next, in the terminal, you need to install all the necessary packages to run the Rapuma publishing system. There are two categories, required and suggested. When you use this command, be sure to review the list of programs that it is proposing to install. Look for any that it might want to remove. Be sure no critical programs are being removed. If you are not sure, do not go any further. Here are packages to install:

Required:

    sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-xetex python-configobj evince python-argparse pdftk mercurial meld

(Note to me: Do we still need these?: python-vte python-mako python-htmlgen)

Another required package is the Palaso Python library. Rapuma depends on a couple parts of that.
At this time, that package needs to be added to your system by cloning the project, then
following the install proceedure. It can be cloned from here:

    hg clone http://hg.palaso.org/palaso-python ~/Projects/palaso-python

This needs to be installed before you can use it. To install run:

    ~/Projects/palaso-python/setu5p.py --nokmn build
    sudo ~/Projects/palaso-python/setup.py --nokmn install

(Note: need to add simple test for install of palaso-python)

Some suggested additional packages to make your Linux DTP system complete:

    sudo apt-get install inkscape libgtk2-spell-perl tortoisehg

Some suggested SIL Packages would be:

    sudo apt-get install libteckit-perl teckit libfont-ttf-scripts-perl

(Note: On newer versions of Ubuntu, the SIL repo may not be up to date so some of the above may not be available.)

Finally, log out and log back in again so the system will properly recognize the newly installed packages and the TortoiseHg package should work correctly.

With all the above packages installed, we are ready to move on to installing Rapuma publishing package.

GETTING Rapuma
-----------------------------------------
To obtain Rapuma, you need to check it out from the Mercurial repository it resides in. To simplify these instructions we will assume that the Rapuma package will go in a folder called "~/Projects" but you are welcomed to put it wherever you want.

Create the above path if it does not exist with this command in your terminal:

    mkdir ~/Projects

Now you can to go to the Palaso website and clone the project code with:

    hg clone http://hg.palaso.org/pub-rpm ~/Projects/rapuma

That should put Rapuma where you need it. From time to time you may want to update it. To do that, from inside the Rapuma project folder (~/Projects/rapuma), this is the command you need:

    hg pull --update


PACKAGE INSTALLATION AND SETUP
-----------------------------------------
Like the palaso.python setup you will use the setup.py script. With a terminal in the root of the rapuma repository on your local machine, run:

    ./setup.py build
    sudo ./setup.py install

To test the instalation, type:

    rapuma -h

What you should get is a Rapuma help screen. To get started using it, read the quickstart file that is in the rapuma repo directory.

This will help you setup a new Rapuma installation and show you a couple, hopefully useful, exercises.


RAPUMA SETUP
-----------------------------------------
Once Rapuma is installed, there really is not much setup to do. The first thing you will want to do is set the user name. To do that, use this command:

    rapuma setting system rapuma --section System --key userName --value "<Your Name>"

Set your user ID (no spaces) with...

    rapuma setting system rapuma --section System --key userID --value "<Whatever your ID is>"

Set the default path to your publishing projects folder (change path as necessary):

    rapuma setting system rapuma --section System --key projects --value "~/Publishing"

Set the path to the "Cloud" (Internet storage like Dropbox):

    rapuma setting system rapuma --section System --key cloud --value "~/Dropbox/Publishing"

This completes the basic setup routine for Rapuma. Now you can try the examples.


RAPUMA EXAMPLES
-----------------------------------------
Rapuma comes with an example project. The tutorial document for this project is found in the Rapuma folder under resource/example/KYUM_ExampleAndTotorial.odt. To learn how to setup and manage a project, consult this document.

This will help you setup a new Rapuma installation and show you a couple, hopefully useful, exercises.


RAPUMA SETUP
-----------------------------------------
Once Rapuma is installed, there really is not much setup to do. The first thing you will want to do is set the user name. To do that, use this command:

    rapuma setting system rapuma --section System --key userName --value "<Your Name>"

Set your user ID (no spaces) with...

    rapuma setting system rapuma --section System --key userID --value "<Whatever your ID is>"

Rapuma needs to keep its projects in one location. The default path to your publishing projects folder is either ~/Publishing, if it is a desktop installation, or /var/www/rapuma/publishing, if it is being run on a server. It is possible to suply an alternate path for Rapuma to use. The following commands would be examples:

    rapuma setting system rapuma --section System --key projects --value "~/Documents/Pub"
    
    or something like...
    
    rapuma setting system rapuma --section System --key projects --value "/var/www/mypubs"
    
With this set, Rapuma will use the alternate location to create and store projects. If this is not set, Rapuma will use the default location for the type of environment it is being used in. It is recomended that alternate locations not be used as permission problems can be encountered.  
    

Set the path to the "Cloud" (Internet storage like Dropbox):

    rapuma setting system rapuma --section System --key cloud --value "~/Dropbox/Publishing"

This completes the basic setup routine for Rapuma. Now you can try the examples.


RAPUMA EXAMPLES
-----------------------------------------
Rapuma comes with an example project. The tutorial document for this project is found in the Rapuma folder under resource/example/KYUM_ExampleAndTotorial.odt. To learn how to setup and manage a project, consult this document.

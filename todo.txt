1) In the context of a PT project, get the system to look for the .sty files
    in the local project first, then out into the parent (My Paratext Projects)
    folder. This way, if the project was a backup, it will be sure to get the
    right .sty files in case mods needed to be made.
    
2) Look for subprocess calles that use os.system() and change them over to
    the much nicer subprocess.call() module.

omitAllChapterNumbers = false

# MARGINAL VERSES
Description = To use marginal verses (flying verse numbers) set this to 'true'.  Choices: (true | false) - Default = false

omitVerseNumberOne = false

# CHAPTER VERSE SEPARATOR
Description = Change the default c/v separator character or adjust the space by adding some extra code.  For example, to kern the space between the separator character you could enter: "\kern.02em:\kern.02em".  This setting primary affects the header reference.   Default = ":"
chapterVerseSeparator = \kern.1em:\kern.1em

# AFTER VERSE SPACE FACTOR
Description = You may need a little extra space following the verse numbers.  This will add space in this context with a factore that is related to the \FontSizeUnit, this way it scales with the text.  This can be used with both in-line and marginal verse layouts.   Default = 2

# AFTER CHAPTER SPACE FACTOR

# ADORN VERSE NUMBER SETTING
Description = By placing a properly formated setting in this field, TeX will place a verse adornment like parenthesis or anything else you may want to specify.

This is a contextual setting depending on how many columns are being used.  It will output both the \singlecolumnshift and \columnshift commands in the TeX settings file.  This is a usfmTex setting and is not part of the standard ptx2pdf macro package.  Only enter the number of millimeters, do not add "mm" as That will be added by the system.   Default = 0
columnShift = 6

# COLUMNGUTTERRULESKIP (mm)
Description = It may be necessary to push the top of the gutter rule down a few mm.  By setting the number to be greater than zero this will enable you to adjust where the line begins at the top of the page. (Not included in standard ptx2pdf macros).

Description = Set the default hyphen character to insert at hyphenation breaks.  The normal is '‐' (U+2010) but it could be changed to use something like U+200B (ZWSP) Just change the character setting in the value. (Note that normally in the hyphenation word list source text you will find U+002D, a minus sign which also doubles for a hyphen character but it is not a proper one.) Remember to put a '"' (double quote) before the Unicode value, TeX needs this.   Default = "2010

# PRETOLERANCE
Description = Pretolerance is an integer parameter that is used in TeX's line breaking algorithm as described below.  Use an integer from -1 to 10000.

Normally it is always best to allow TeX to use its defaults first so the setting here is nothing by default.   Default = nothingetPretolerance = ""

# SOURCE ENCODING TRANSFORM

sourceEncodeTransform = true

# FINAL HYPHEN BREAK RULES
Description = With some languages there may be consistent and easy places to break a word and these breaks can be applied automatically when the hyphen exceptions word list is being generated.  This is done by including a simple (or not so simple) regular expression (regex) in this field.  Example: (?u).(\u1064|\u1038)(?=\w.) This regex notation will be used in the hyphen word list generator to increase the number of breaks that can occur on words that qualify.

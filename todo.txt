RPM ToDo List

This contains a listing of things that should be worked on sooner than later.

Add more "do not edit" warnings to any remaining auto-generated files the system makes

Add positional arguments to argparse for parts of categories that do not need
    them as an option. Example: rpm project KYU-LATN-NTCAT -n (would start a new project)

Add a todo listing feature to the log file that would produce a todo file. This
    would be for situations where an error occured because the user did not
    do something they should have. It would tell them what they need to do
    to fix the problem. If no problems occured, no todo file would be generated.
    The error log would be just for problems that are not necessarily solved
    by the user. This would be a new category of lot message and require special
    handling.

Update pt_tools.getPTSettings() to look in parent and grandparent folders for
    the .ssf file.

Begin adding repo capabilities. Start with useRepository flag and build some
    routines that will add a designated file to the projects repo. Later, make
    some kind of s/r command. Look to see what Chorus might do for us.

Add a paper size dictionary that can be used to automatically fill in the
    width and height of the page.  This might already exsit so do a search for
    one first.

Add a switch to the add component command that would have the system do a
    little preprocess check on the incoming text. If it fails, deliver the error
    message to user in a resonable form.

Create an error message dictionary that would contain all known RPM errors.
    This would be good if it ever needed translation and also for common
    errors that might occure in different places. This would give them a
    consistant message.

% To follow is the TeX hyphenation words exclusion list.
% Each word in this publication that may need to be hyphenated
% (in the context of Rapuma) will need to be specified below.
% For example, a word like "hyphenate" would be represented like
% this: "hy-phen-ate". Use a standard hyphen character (U+002D)
% between word forming characters. If there are any words that
% you do not want broken, list those too, as you wish them to be
% in the text. Please form a list below between the open { and the
% close }.

\hyphenation{
% hy-phen-ate
% Abraham
}


RAPUMA QUICK START GUIDE
-----------------------------------------
Rapuma comes with a couple demonstration projects that are used to demonstrate what it can do and also test the system when revisions are made. There is a module named "rapuma_demo" that can be called on to do this but to make it easier for normal users, some short-cut scripts have been included to simplify running the test projects.

Once Rapuma is setup, and you want to test it, open a terminal and navigate to someplace on your drive where you can let Rapuma install the test projects. Once you are there, use this command:

    test_rapuma.sh

Three things should result from doing this. First, your PDF viewer should be displaying freshly rendered PDF of the Book of James. This came from the ENG-LATN-JAS project located in the MBJAS folder. In that folder you will find all project data it took to do that. That was the second thing the test script did. The third result is a project folder work area named KYUM. This project contains a lot more data and specifcally, the KYU-MYMR-MRK project, which is a far more complex project than ENG-LATN-JAS.

What happened to produce these three outcomes goes beyond the scope of this quick start guide. [NOTE: Soon I hope to have a pointer here to readme files that will be in each of the two projects. These files will go into much greater detail as to what has been done and what can be done. They will guide the user/explore in some exercizes that will put Rapuma through its paces.]

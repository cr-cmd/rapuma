This is for installing a beta package of TECkit. TECkit can be used
for some "special effects" like number mapping, and other on-the-fly
encoding conversion actions while XeTeX is rendering. 

If a publishing project does not come with a pre-compiled TECkit mapping,
one will need to be mapped and compiled. For this, TECkit will need to
be installed on your system. The instructions below are taken from an email
from Neil Mayhew <neil_mayhew@sil.org> for a beta package he was working
on at the time. (Sep. 2015)

I had to do some more work on the packaging due to a change in the way
perl installs its libraries in newer distros (utopic onwards). However,
I've built 2.5.4~beta1 packages for precise, trusty, utopic and vivid,
and uploaded them to the -experimental section of packages.sil.org. If
you don't have this enabled, you need the following lines in
/etc/apt/sources.list, or on their own in a file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d:

deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu/ trusty main universe multiverse restricted #SIL
deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu/ trusty-experimental main universe multiverse restricted #SIL experimental

Replace "trusty" with "vivid" if you're using the latest Ubuntu. You'll
also need to add the repo key if you haven't used packages.sil.org on
this machine before. Instructions are at http://packages.sil.org/

The teckit package still has the conflict with texlive-binaries, since I
haven't had a chance to fix that yet, but for others who may need it,
there's a manual workaround. Before installing teckit,

sudo dpkg-divert --package teckit --rename --add /usr/bin/teckit_compile

The libteckit-dev package is currently uninstallable due to a typo in
the specification of dependencies, but I don't think you'll need it. The
libteckit-perl package is OK, however.

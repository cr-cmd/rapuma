%%%%% Custom footnote caller font (special characters)
% This enables a custom font to be used for footnote/crossref
% caller characters. Normally, by default, the font that is
% used is the same as the body text. For situations where a
% different character or style of character is needed, you
% can specify another font. This is a group of styles that
% include \Marker fncaller, \Marker f and \Marker x.

% Define a special caller style and add a hook to tie it
% to a font (\callerfont) that is defined elsewhere in
% the TeX system by RPM.

    systemName = Rapuma (Rapid Publication Manager)
    systemAbout = "Rapuma is a publishing management system written by the friendly developers at Palaso (Payap Universitys Linguistics Institute). Rapuma stands for Rapid Publication Manager. It is currently being deployed in the Mainland Southeast Asia Group (MSEAG) and is under heavy development. Anyone wanting to try this system should be warned that it may not work in their context. However, the underlying principals of the system should work in any long document publishing environment. Therefore the package should be evaluated with that in mind. We welcome input and participation in this project. It is our hope it will be able to serve more than just MSEAG. For questions or more information please write the maintainers."

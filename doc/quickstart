
RAPUMA QUICK START GUIDE
-----------------------------------------
This will help you setup a new Rapuma installation and show you a couple, hopefully useful, exercises.


RAPUMA SETUP
-----------------------------------------
Once Rapuma is installed, there really is not much setup to do. The first thing you will want to do is set the user name. To do that, use this command:

    rapuma system -u "<Your Name>"

Rapuma manages a number of resources. It is often nice to put those in the folder where your publishing projects are, but that is not strictly necessary. To create the group of folders where the Rapuma resources will be kept, use this command:

    rapuma system -r "<valid path>"

Rapuma will create a folder named "Rapuma" following the path you gave it. Inside that folder will be a number of other folders for things such as backups, archives, templates, etc.

This completes the basic setup routine for Rapuma. Now you can try the examples.


RAPUMA EXAMPLES
-----------------------------------------
Rapuma comes with a couple example projects that help demonstrate what it can do and also test the system when revisions are made. If you ran the resources setup as noted above you will find several ZIP files in your Rapuma examples folder. Copy those compressed files to a folder where you can extract each of them. Then follow the readme file directions that are included with each example file.

This concludes our Quick Start Guide. Hopefully, in the not so distant future there will be more tutorial available.

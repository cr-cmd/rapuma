% This is a hyphenation test file for the Rapuma KJV example. This contains
% a simple hyphenation inventory of one word for this publication. The
% word is "prophet" is found on the first page of the Book of John.
% normally this word would not be broken with a hyphen as we have done.
% However, doing it this way causes that word to break about mid-way
% down on the right column of the first page of the book. By turning
% hyphenation on and off you can see if it works or not. Note that if
% you move the hyphen character you can see how TeX responds. Obviously
% proper hyphenation should follow rules and the hyphen character is not
% radomly located as it is here.
%
% One final not about hyphenation in Rapuma. Hyphenation in TeX is
% normally done with carefully crafted rules that TeX uses to break words
% in the proper place. It also allows for exceptions. With most minority
% langauges, the actual hyphenation rules have not been formed so hyphenation
% cannot work. However, by using an execeptions list, we can get TeX to
% break words as described in list like below. That is what this file is
% for.

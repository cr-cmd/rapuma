This contains a listing of things that should be worked on sooner than later.

1) In the context of a PT project, get the system to look for the .sty files
    in the local project first, then out into the parent (My Paratext Projects)
    folder. This way, if the project was a backup, it will be sure to get the
    right .sty files in case mods needed to be made.
    
2) Look for subprocess calls that use os.system() and change them over to
    the much nicer subprocess.call() module.
    
3) Begin adding repo capabilities. Start with useRepository flag and build some
    routines that will add a designated file to the projects repo. Later, make
    some kind of s/r command. Look to see what Chorus might do for us.
    
4) Add a paper size dictionary that can be used to automatically fill in the
    width and height of the page.  This might already exsit so do a search for
    one first.

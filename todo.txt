Update pt_tools.getPTSettings() to look in parent and grandparent folders for
    the .ssf file.

Update the KYUL example with latest source (without \sls marker).

Begin adding repo capabilities. Start with useRepository flag and build some
    routines that will add a designated file to the projects repo. Later, make
    some kind of s/r command. Look to see what Chorus might do for us.

Add a paper size dictionary that can be used to automatically fill in the
    width and height of the page.  This might already exsit so do a search for
    one first.

Add a switch to the add component command that would have the system do a
    little preprocess check on the incoming text. If it fails, deliver the error
    message to user in a resonable form.
